# Docker-based Hand Labs Test - USACH
- Bash code created for the administration and management of vulnerable webs based on Docker.
- The code was created for the Kali-Linux based distribution.

# myexamdocker.sh

### Hacking Web Sites and Linux Training:
1. Metasplotaible2
2. bWapp
3. DVWA

### Usage

1. Clone the directory
`$ git clone https://github.com/h4cha/usach-dockerexam.git
2. Access to directory, grant execution permissions and execute the shell
`cd usach-dockerexam`

`chmod +x myexamdocker.sh`

`./myexamdocker.sh [help] [list] [status] [start {metasplotaible2,bwapp,dvwa}] [info {metasplotaible2,bwapp,dvwa}]`


### Modules:
-------------
### Metasplotaible2
A test environment provides a secure place to perform penetration testing and security research. For your test environment, you need a Metasploit instance that can access a vulnerable target.

### bWaPP
bWAPP, or a buggy web application, is a free and open source deliberately insecure web application.
It helps security enthusiasts, developers and students to discover and to prevent web vulnerabilities.
bWAPP prepares one to conduct successful penetration testing and ethical hacking projects.

### DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.
